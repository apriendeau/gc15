## Guide Program
Technical conferences can be a busy and stressful time! What talks should you attend? What projects should you follow?  With everything going on, how can you make the most of your experience, while still taking the time to meet new people and make new connections?  It can be hard, especially for a first-time attendee or new community member.

Your friendly GopherCon organizers understand this (we were new once, too!), so this year we thought we'd do something a little special to help people make the most of their experience: we created The GopherCon Guide Program.

Whether you need advice on what talks to attend, are interested in pursuing a career in Go development, want to meet new and interesting people, or just want a friendly face in the crowd, we've got you covered.  We've lined up some really stellar Gophers our first time around, and they have agreed to dedicate some of their time to YOU.

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, follow the link below to apply and help us help you to make our conference even better!
