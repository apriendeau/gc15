## Colorado Convention Center
Opened in 1990, with more than 100 professional meeting planners working together with architects to design every aspect of the building, the result was simple; a sensible, state-of-the-art facility with easy traffic flow and everything you need in a stunningly beautiful building in the heart of downtown Denver. Expanded in 2005, well-known as one of the most practical and “user friendly” meeting facilities, the Colorado Convention Center is now home to over 250+ events annually. The Colorado Convention Center is located within easy walking distance of over 8,700 hotel rooms, 300 restaurants, 9 theatres of the Denver Performing Arts Complex and a wide variety of shopping and retail outlets.
