#GopherCon 2015 Announces 2015 Speakers
##World's Largest Gathering of Go Developers In Denver On July 7-10
Denver, CO: Today, GopherAcademy, LLC announced the speakers for their annual conference celebrating the Go Programming Language. After a sold-out conference in 2014, GopherCon is expanding this year, to the Colorado Convention Center, where they will host 1,500 Go enthusiasts from around the globe. This three day conference will be the largest gathering of Go developers ever. The newly announced speakers include engineers with diverse backgrounds from companies large and small.

Once again, GopherCon has a variety of sponsors that highlights the impact this programming language has had on the industry. "Written for the cloud, Go was designed to solve a wide range of computing problems by providing a powerful and easy to understand way to write reliable code," said Jason Buberel, Product Manager at Google. "GopherCon has been instrumental in bringing that community of developers together and we are proud to be a Diamond Sponsor of the event." 

Even companies traditionally known for infrastructure are realizing the benefits of Go. Cisco's Keith Chambers said: "We love Go for building distributed systems at Cisco. While we believe in polyglot microservices, the teams that have embraced Go are delivering new services to market in less time. Cisco wants to see the Go community grow and we believe sponsoring GopherCon is a great way to do that!"

Two great examples of companies that have built entirely new economies around Go are Docker, Inc. and CoreOS. “We wanted to support this event because the Go language has been absolutely essential to the growth and adoption of Docker,” said Steve Francia, chief operator of the Docker project. “Go is at the heart of the Docker project, providing the simplicity, reliability and feature set we need to create a strong foundation for the community. We look forward to GopherCon and collaborating with the developers and contributors that share our passion for Go and the Go community.”

Alex Polvi, CEO of CoreOS writes: "GopherCon is an important event for CoreOS because we have built many of our components with Go," said Alex. "Go has propelled the container industry forward by providing a language that is easy to build reliant distributed systems. We are big supporters of Go and GopherCon and look forward to celebrating all things Go in July.”

The momentum of Go has captured the attention of venture capital firms, as well. Robin Vasan of Mayfield tells us: “The software stack is being re-imagined with a distributed systems architecture – and the Go community is right at the heart of that effort.”

This year, GopherCon also includes a pair of optional workshops on July 7 th with workshops available for both beginning and advanced programmers. “Our conference this year aims to build on the tremendous success of the sold-out GopherCon 2014,” said Erik St. Martin from Gopher Academy, LLC. “Last year we saw many early adopters of Go at GopherCon. This year, it's clear that the attendees are coming equally from Fortune 500 companies, small to medium businesses, and startups.  We're excited to be providing such a large venue for developers of all backgrounds to come together and advance their craft.”
