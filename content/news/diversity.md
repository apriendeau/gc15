#### Diversity Scholarship Applications
If you are a member of an under-represented group and need help attending GopherCon 2015, we've created a scholarship application.  Please fill out [this form]() and we'll do our best to help finance your trip using the donations of the community.  We at GopherAcademy strongly believe in creating an environment where everyone is welcome to enjoy the speed, elegance, and fun concurrency of Go.


#### Child Care
We have finalized details of our Child Care arrangements.  We'll have dedicated rooms for child care right at the conference.  If you need child care in order to attend GopherCon, please pre-register by following the "Tickets" links on this site, and registering your children by selecting the appropriate age groups. This will help us ensure that we have enough qualified child-care professionals to meet the demand.  We are hiring licensed professionals to staff our rooms, so you can enjoy the conference without worrying about your children.

#### Kids Code
If you or your company is interested in arranging a learning session for the older children during GopherCon get in touch with us today : gophercon@gopheracademy.com

#### Donate To Make a Difference
Finally, we can't help bring people to GopherCon without the donations from the Go community.  If you can help us make a more diverse conference, please purchase Diversity Scholarship tickets [here](https://ti.to/gophercon/gophercon-2015/with/bmhktj3apgi).  Thank you for your support.
