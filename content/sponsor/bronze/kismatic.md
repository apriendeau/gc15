Kismatic is the enterprise Kubernetes company. Kubernetes is a vibrant and fast-growing open source project created by and based on Google's 10+ years of experience managing Linux container-based applications at massive scale.

Kismatic was founded to bring Google-scale datacenter management to the enterprise. Our offerings maximize developer productivity and minimize hardware costs. We do this by collapsing disparate developer and operations workflows into a unified cluster orchestration platform through creating a homogenous pool of datacenter resources that runs applications and services with a few clicks and scales to thousands of machines running seamlessly in the cloud both private and public.
