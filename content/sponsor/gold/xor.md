XOR Data Exchange has developed the nationâ€™s first patent-pending permission-based data exchange, where data owners set finely tuned permissions for how their data is used. Unlike a consortium, which is limited in scope, single focused and has a one-to-one sharing relationship, XOR data exchanges can be used by any industry to share any data for any purpose allowed by the data owner, including fraud and risk management, and authentication.  XOR proudly employs Brian and Erik, organizers of GopherCon, and uses a 100% Go-powered platform to deliver breakthrough performance for our Fortune 100 customers.
