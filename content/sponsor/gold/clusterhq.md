At ClusterHQ, we describe ourselves as The Container Data Peopleâ„¢. We believe that support for databases and other stateful services is a major missing piece of the puzzle for containers and Docker. Without support for data migration, high availability and disaster recovery, containers are unable to easily capture entire applications (including databases, queues, and key-value stores) in production in a way that ops can manage. Why should the heart of most applications live outside the container?
