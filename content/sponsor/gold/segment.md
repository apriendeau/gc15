Segment is building the analytics routing layer for the world. We transform data into over 150 different services, adding new ones every day. We're processing billions of events each month, and maintaining the analytics infrastructure for companies like Rdio, Bonobos, and Atlassian. We're go-nuts for everything from our queueing layer to our data processing pipeline (and we <3 open source). The gopher is our spirit animal.
