The DCOS makes it easy to build service-oriented applications. It supports Docker containers, avoids over provisioning for small services and manages them all on a single platform. Within minutes, you can install over 40 services with a single command, including Spark, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Hadoop. Learn more at [mesosphere.com](http://mesosphere.com).
