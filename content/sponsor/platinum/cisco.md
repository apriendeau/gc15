Cisco and our partners are building InterCloud to enable developers to launch exciting new Internet of Things (IoT) applications. InterCloud is a global distributed network of public and private clouds, designed to accelerate delivery of high-value application workloads and real-time analytics with near infinite scalability. Cisco is proud to sponsor Gophercon and we ourselves develop several InterCloud services in Go.
