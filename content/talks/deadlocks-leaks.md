Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) are a foundational element of writing Go code. Our Go application, Pillar, processes 15 gigabits per second, packages over 3000 channels, serves millions of users, and runs on more than 450 servers nationwide.

While writing Pillar, we developed five guidelines for the use of Go and CSP. Guidelines that helped us prevent deadlocks, prevent resource leaks, and simplified our code. Go developers will find lasting value in these battle-tested guidelines.
