Every once in a while, a new programming language comes up that fundamentally changes how we think about computing. But even more so often, the core ideas behind a "new" language are hinged upon ideas that were first propounded by languages or systems which are much older.

Often our understanding of a language's features and the intentions thereof are limited by our understanding of its roots.

In this talk, BG will talk about the origins of the core ideas behind Go and will take you on a "language-archeology" tour where we'll trace the roots of Go.
