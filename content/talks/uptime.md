Hear about Fog Creek’s first production Go service: a rewrite of their Git and Mercurial SSH reverse proxy from Python. See how they monitor memory, who’s currently connected, what actions they’re performing, what their code is doing, and how they implement drain-and-die so a connection is never forcefully closed. Response times halved. Scheduled daily restarts were replaced with multi-month uptime, and shoulder shrugging about recent crashes were replaced with detailed forensic logs. 

Pick up some tips on how to write resilient services with Go!
