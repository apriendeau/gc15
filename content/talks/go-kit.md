Go has emerged as the language of the server, but it remains underrepresented in large, consumer-focused companies like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and SoundCloud. These organizations have largely adopted JVM-based tech stacks for their business logic, owing in large part to libraries and ecosystems that directly support their service-oriented architectures.

To reach its next level of success, Go needs more than simple primitives and idioms. It needs a comprehensive toolkit, for coherent distributed programming in the large. This talk describes Go kit, a toolkit for Go in the modern SOA.
