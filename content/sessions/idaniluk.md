Concurrency in Go has been explained many times in a variety of articles, but there is time to explain it visually using the power of 3D modeling and animations.

I've built a tool that can visually represent concurrent Go programs using WebGL in a browser.

We'll watch common concurrency patterns in real time 3D animations and will learn visually how does parallelism differ from concurrency.
