Blake is currently a developer at Fog Creek Software, working on the backend systems for Kiln and FogBugz. Before that, he spent several years as an enterprise Java developer. It wasn't until Google I/O last year that he learned that his whole life was a lie. Once bitten by the gopher, there was no going back. When not coding in Go, he's hardware hacking with a Raspberry Pi and a soldering iron.
