Blake is currently a backend developer at CloudHelix, Inc. Until recently, he was a developer at Fog Creek Software. Prior to that, he spent several years writing enterprise Java code. It wasn’t until Google I/O last year that he learned that his whole life was a lie. Once bitten by the gopher, there was no going back. When not coding in Go, he’s hardware hacking with a Raspberry Pi and a soldering iron.
