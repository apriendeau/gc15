Go for Mobile Devices

How cool would it be to write an app for your Android or iOS phone in your favorite language, Go? 

Since Go 1.4, Android on ARM is one of the officially supported platforms, and Go 1.5 will include iOS support for ARM. I will present the status of Android/iOS support in Go 1.5, and the efforts around the golang.org/x/mobile repository, which hosts tools and libraries for mobile app development in Go.
