Brian has been floundering with Bootstrap since 2009.
At last, the UK community has decided to organise a Go conference for the UK and rest of the world! Save the date: Friday 21st August 2015. Even though it’s the first Golang UK conference there is an experienced team behind it: we have previously organised other tech conferences (one with ~700 attendees last year) and numerous meetups of the Go London User Group. We are currently looking for people to give talks so please submit a paper if you want to meet the great UK community.
