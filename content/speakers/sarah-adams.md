Code generation for the sake of consistency

Maintaining consistency within a growing project is a challenge. I have struggled with my company's Go web API as it has grown over the past two years, trying to find a nice solution to this intra-project consistency problem without resorting to a large-scale framework.

In my mind, there are three general layers to project consistency:
- consistency in implementation among similar bits of code
- consistency in black-box behavior among similar endpoints or commands
- consistency between actual behavior and documented behavior (documentation accuracy)

This talk will outline how I have leveraged small-scale code and documentation generator tools for each of the three layers outlined above, specifically for the sake of consistency in a growing Go application without using a large-scale framework.

Sarah started writing Go in August of 2013. She gets excited about tools that make things like code-consistency, tests and documentation more doable. Sarah is a big fan of Rob Pikeâ€™s. She hopes to shake his hand this year at Gophercon. If you are sitting next to Rob Pike, kindly let him know.
