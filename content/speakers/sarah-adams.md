Code generation for the sake of consistency

---

Sarah started writing Go in August of 2013. She gets excited about tools that make things like code-consistency, tests and documentation more doable. Sarah is a big fan of Rob Pikeâ€™s. She hopes to shake his hand this year at Gophercon. If you are sitting next to Rob Pike, kindly let him know.
