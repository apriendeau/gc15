Betting the Company on Go and Winning - The Good, the Bad, and Dependency Management

Since the very beginning CoreOS bet the farm on Go, even before it became the popular language it is today. CoreOS builds and ships components that enable users to create distributed systems from the ground up. Just about everything CoreOS builds including our popular open source projects such as etcd, fleet, and rocket are built using Go; this also holds true for most CoreOS commercial offerings.

But how did we do it? What challenges did we face?

In this talk we will answer these questions and provide a retrospective, if you will, on using Go at CoreOS over the years.
