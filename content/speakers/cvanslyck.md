Carolyn is a software developer from Chicago, though one day she hopes to escape to the Pacific Northwest in search of faster internet, free-range kittens and respite from snow blowers.

She loves all things automation, developer tools and anything that will make her fellow developers lives easier; so she's found a good home at Rackspace on the Developer Experience team.

Like a grafted bonsai, her roots come from many places: happily developing C# applications on a Mac and deploying to Linux.
