Embrace the Interface

Go gives us powerful abstraction through interfaces with no bureaucracy. In my quest to find the right balance between pragmatism and abstraction, I have developed some useful patterns that leverage Go's interfaces to make code modular, lean and clean.

This is a hands-on opinionated talk about software craftsmanship and sane abstraction techniques. This is a talk where you'll learn how to embrace the interface.

Tomás' journey with Go started at SoundCloud nearly [3 years ago](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi). He is the author of [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta), an HTTP load testing tool and library written in Go. While not thinking about elegant solutions to large scale problems, computational or not, Tomás enjoy life in his home city: Berlin.
