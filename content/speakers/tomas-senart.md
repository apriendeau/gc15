Tomás' journey with Go started at SoundCloud nearly [3 years ago](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi). He is the author of [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta), an HTTP load testing tool and library written in Go. While not thinking about elegant solutions to large scale problems, computational or not, Tomás enjoy life in his home city: Berlin.
