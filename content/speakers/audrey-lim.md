A former lawyer and a self-taught programmer from the beautiful city of Singapore, Audrey became interested in the world of programming and computer science. She picked up front-end programming in April 2014 before learning Go as her first backend language in July 2014. She's since moved to programming full-time as her career at Nitrous.IO.
