The Many Faces of Struct Tags

Struct tags are a great feature of Go, but in the general Go community they receive almost no attention. In this talk we want to show you some of the cleverest and weirdest uses of struct tags weâ€™ve seen.

Come join us for a tour of our favorite practical and impractical uses of an underutilized part of Go.
