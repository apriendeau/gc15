Filippo Valsorda does cryptography and systems engineering at CloudFlare.

He's the main developer of the pure-Go CloudFlare DNS server, and wrote its DNSSEC implementation.

He often writes about Go on the company blog, talks about security and programming, and builds small Go demos like the Heartbleed test and the whoami SSH server.

He once wrote about building Python modules in Go, and got the memory allocations wrong.
