                        <p>Go has emerged as the language of the server, but it remains underrepresented in large, consumer-focused companies like
                          Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and SoundCloud. These organizations have largely adopted JVM-based tech stacks for their business
                          logic, owing in large part to libraries and ecosystems that directly support their service-oriented architectures.</p>
                        <p>To reach its next level of success, Go needs more than simple primitives and idioms. It needs a comprehensive toolkit, for
                          coherent distributed programming in the large. This talk describes Go kit, a toolkit for Go in the modern SOA.</p>

                        <p>A good debugger is an essential tool for any software engineer – but Go has some unique characteristics (the runtime scheduler,
                          for instance) that make traditional debuggers unfeasible. So I wrote Delve, a debugger tailored specifically for Go.</p>
                        <p>When your software misbehaves, how can you glean insight into its unruliness?</p>
                        <p>To answer that we’ll take a deep dive into Delve. We’ll explore what makes software like Delve work, how it aims to solve

                        <p>Maintaining consistency within a growing project is a challenge. I have struggled with my company’s Go web API as it has
                          grown over the past two years, trying to find a nice solution to this intra-project consistency problem without resorting
                          to a large-scale framework.</p>
                        <p>In my mind, there are three general layers to project consistency:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>consistency in implementation among similar bits of code</li>
                          <li>consistency in black-box behavior among similar endpoints or commands</li>
                          <li>consistency between actual behavior and documented behavior (documentation accuracy)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This talk will outline how I have leveraged small-scale code and documentation generator tools for each of the three layers
                          outlined above, specifically for the sake of consistency in a growing Go application without using a large-scale framework.</p>

                        <p>Long garbage collection (GC) pauses stand directly in the way of Go’s growth. It is an important, and often times the only,
                          technical reason practitioners give for not migrating to managed runtimes such as Go. If Go is to live up to its promise

                        <p>Every once in a while, a new programming language comes up that fundamentally changes how we think about computing. But
                          even more so often, the core ideas behind a “new” language are hinged upon ideas that were first propounded by languages

                        <p>Often our understanding of a language’s features and the intentions thereof are limited by our understanding of its roots.</p>
