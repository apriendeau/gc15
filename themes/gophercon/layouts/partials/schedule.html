                        <p>Go has emerged as the language of the server, but it remains underrepresented in large, consumer-focused companies like
                          Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and SoundCloud. These organizations have largely adopted JVM-based tech stacks for their business
                          logic, owing in large part to libraries and ecosystems that directly support their service-oriented architectures.</p>
                        <p>To reach its next level of success, Go needs more than simple primitives and idioms. It needs a comprehensive toolkit, for
                          coherent distributed programming in the large. This talk describes Go kit, a toolkit for Go in the modern SOA.</p>

                        <p>A good debugger is an essential tool for any software engineer – but Go has some unique characteristics (the runtime scheduler,
                          for instance) that make traditional debuggers unfeasible. So I wrote Delve, a debugger tailored specifically for Go.</p>
                        <p>When your software misbehaves, how can you glean insight into its unruliness?</p>

                        <p>Maintaining consistency within a growing project is a challenge. I have struggled with my company’s Go web API as it has
                          grown over the past two years, trying to find a nice solution to this intra-project consistency problem without resorting
                          to a large-scale framework.</p>
                        <p>In my mind, there are three general layers to project consistency:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>consistency in implementation among similar bits of code</li>
                          <li>consistency in black-box behavior among similar endpoints or commands</li>
                          <li>consistency between actual behavior and documented behavior (documentation accuracy)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This talk will outline how I have leveraged small-scale code and documentation generator tools for each of the three layers
                          outlined above, specifically for the sake of consistency in a growing Go application without using a large-scale framework.</p>

                        <p>Every once in a while, a new programming language comes up that fundamentally changes how we think about computing. But
                          even more so often, the core ideas behind a “new” language are hinged upon ideas that were first propounded by languages
                          or systems which are much older.</p>
                        <p>Often our understanding of a language’s features and the intentions thereof are limited by our understanding of its roots.</p>
                        <p>In this talk, BG will talk about the origins of the core ideas behind Go and will take you on a “language-archeology” tour

Just beyond the bar, the Mercantile Room will host a special tasting area for the evening. For guests that want to learn more about Colorado’s local brewery explosion, four (4) professional beer experts will be on-hand to answer questions on all matters of beer, including brewing processes, storage, serving, and sampling. Hops and grains such as wheat, barley and rye will be displayed in glass containers, while tasting notes will allow guests to have an interactive and hands-on experience under the guidance of our brew experts.</p>
                      <p>In addition to the main level, guests will have use of the Wynkoop’s entire second floor pool hall. This expansive space features a large bar, ample seating, dartboards, pool tables, table shuffleboard, and foosball.</p>

                          two tools are related to bug finding, and the tracer can give insights into performance and latency issues of Go programs.

                        <p>Hear about Fog Creek’s first production Go service: a rewrite of their Git and Mercurial SSH reverse proxy from Python.
                          See how they monitor memory, who’s currently connected, what actions they’re performing, what their code is doing, and how
                          they implement drain-and-die so a connection is never forcefully closed. Response times halved. Scheduled daily restarts
                          were replaced with multi-month uptime, and shoulder shrugging about recent crashes were replaced with detailed forensic logs.</p>

                        <p>Go can be seen as a language that is too difficult for beginner programmers. The resources and documentation for the language
                          seem too technically advanced for the beginner to pick up fundamental programming concepts. Nevertheless within 5 weeks of
                          looking into Go I taught myself how to build my first CRUD web application and a week later, an API client. In this talk
                          I will share my thoughts about why I think Go is a fantastic teaching tool, and why beginners should not be afraid to learn

                        <p>Struct tags are a great feature of Go, but in the general Go community they receive almost no attention. In this talk we
                          want to show you some of the cleverest and weirdest uses of struct tags we’ve seen. Specifying json and xml fields in struct
                          tags is commonplace, but have you thought about using tags for object-relational mapping, validation functions, defining
                          middleware, or command line options? Come join us for a tour of our favorite practical and impractical uses of an underutilized
                          part of Go.</p>
